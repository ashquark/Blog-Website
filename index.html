       <p>Hi,</p>
       <p>
            This is the sophomore entry of my blog. I didn't know whether I would be able to make an entry today, to be honest, technically, I am making this entry on the 17th. It was just a supremely awful day. I woke up to a very harrowing phone call that completely ruined my precious Sunday. I was almost on the verge of not making this entry but anyways here I am.
       </p>
       <p>
            This entry is going to be one of those entries where I would write mostly about my day and about myself. It is more akin to a diary entry than a log. I didn't knew that this would happen so soon. So continuing the story, I couldn't do anything today. I didn't make any progress in my studies or any other avenue, what I did do was to slip down more on the edge of a mental breakdown. I am surprised that I am still holding up. I wish I could write my sorrows here but the nature of the grievance prevents me to. I feel constantly suffocated, in over my feelings. There is no one I could share these things with or rather no one who'd even understand or listen to me. Yes, it all seems very sad and I didn't want for my second entry only to be like this and that is why I almost didn't make one today. This entry is for consitency more than venting out my feelings, although, that did help a little and the fact that I am making an entry also alleviates my sense of productivity.  
       </p>
       <p>
            As I decided that with each entry I would progress more technically and include new thing each time, I included CSS today. I did a very basic styling of the page. I originally planned to do a much more extensive job of it, but alas couldn't manage to. I will do it over the next few days now as the week will begin from tommorow and so will work. Yes it is a bloody monday tommorow. To monday blues. That's it for now. Logging out.

        <p>Hi, I am Ashutosh Sharma.</p>
        <p>
            I am starting this blog as a personal project and as a way to document my foray into web development. I hope to commit to this blog once a day at least. Today is a routine Saturday, I got some time for myself free of the weekday chore of my job. I wanted to start this project for quite some time now, finally as I write my pilot entry I feel a sense of productivity which I so crave.
        </p>
        <p>
            This first entry is made using just an html file and nothing else, using only basic html. I hope to expand the technology used in this project gradually. I have thought of starting with MERN stack at first, but I will be flexible in using anything new that I learn. I know that this project will not be too complex or some state of the art project or even a novel idea, blogs have been used to their full extent already. The idea behind this project is to just start with the basics and then diverge into more complex, even novel, endeavors. I want to add something new to the project with each blog entry. <i>(Spoiler Alert!)</i> For my next entry I will use CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            The content I have decided will mostly be based on my journey deeper into programming, web development and software engineering but will not be limited to that. I might include the some excerpts about my day, log my daily efforts and even about myself. There is a possibility of a diary entry being squeezed into the mix. I might rediscover my passion for writing through this blog. So this blog satifies multiple requirements and hence I chose to start with it. For now the entries are safely stored (I hope!) on my PC, but before long I will host it. That's it for now. Logging out.
